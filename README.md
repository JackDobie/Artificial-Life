Program based on Boids by Craig Reynolds.<br>
Creates 300 boids and 1 predator. The boids flock together using separation, alignment, and cohesion and will flee if they can see the predator. The predator will try to catch the boids.<br>
Boids have random values for their speed, field of view, and flee distance. The ones with better values will survive longer.<br>
